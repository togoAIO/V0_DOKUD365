<h1 id="supplemental-terms-of-use-for-microsoft-dynamics-365-previews">Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Previews</h1>

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
<p>These Supplemental Terms of Use (&quot;Terms&quot;) cover use of those Microsoft Dynamics 365 previews that link to or incorporate these Terms.</p>
<h2 id="general-terms">General terms</h2>
<p>Dynamics 365 may include preview, beta, or other pre-release features, services, or software,
offered by Microsoft to obtain customer feedback (&quot;Previews&quot;).  Previews are made available to you
on the condition that you agree to these terms of use, which supplement your agreement governing
use of Dynamics 365.</p>
<p>PREVIEWS ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS-IS&quot;, &quot;WITH ALL FAULTS&quot;, AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot;, AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM
THE SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS AND LIMITED WARRANTY.  Previews may not be covered by customer
support.  Preview may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy
commitments, as further explained in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131004&amp;clcid=0x409" title="Microsoft Privacy Statement">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/product-overview" title="Microsoft Dynamics 365 Trust Center">Microsoft Dynamics 365 Trust Center</a>, the <a href="https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&amp;DocumentTypeId=31" title="Online Services Terms">Online Services Terms</a>, and any additional notices provided with the Preview. The following terms in the DPA do not apply to Previews: Processing of Personal Data; GDPR, Data Security, and HIPAA Business Associate. Customers should not use Previews to process Personal Data or other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements. In addition, Customers should not use production data in Previews or use Previews in a 'live operating' or production environment.</p>
<p>Certain named Previews may also be subject to additional terms, if any, set forth below. We may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. We also may choose not to release a Preview into &quot;General Availability&quot;.  In addition, a Preview that is released into General Availability may be subject to a fee even if the Preview was free of charge.</p>
<p>You will provide, as your own expense, the equipment, technology, and infrastructure necessary
to participate in the Previews, unless otherwise specified in the applicable Preview program
description.  In addition, you may use consultants, contractors, advisors, or other third parties
to assist with performing the activities or any professional services in connection with the
Preview, but only if you have entered into an agreement with any such third party that contains
terms at least as protective of Microsoft's rights as those in the agreement governing your use of Dynamics 365. You will bear all
costs and expenses associated with engaging a third party to perform any of your activities in the
Previews.  You may use the Preview only if you have a valid license or subscription to the
required Dynamics 365 application.  You may not access or use the Previews if you do not have the
required license or subscription.</p>
<h2 id="use-preview-in-a-production-environment">Use Preview in a Production Environment</h2>
<p>The &quot;General terms&quot; section applies generally to all Previews that link to these Terms.  This
section contains terms that apply only if a Preview allows you to use Customer Data or Personal
Data (collectively &quot;Data&quot;) in a 'live operating' or production environment and is in addition to
the General Terms.  These &quot;Use Preview in a Production Environment&quot; terms govern if there are any
conflicts with the &quot;General Terms&quot; or the &quot;Service-Specific Terms&quot; sections.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the General Terms, Microsoft hereby grants you
permission to use the Preview to access or process Data in a 'live operating' or production
environment for Dynamics 365 in connection with participating in the Preview.  By accessing or processing Data
in a 'live operating' or production environment, you consent to share your Data with external
systems outside of the geography where your production environment is deployed.</p>
<h2 id="service-specific-terms">Service-specific terms</h2>
<p>The &quot;General Terms&quot; section applies generally to all Previews that link to these Teams.  These
service-specific terms are in addition to the &quot;General Terms&quot; and the &quot;Use Preview in a Production
Environment&quot; sections.  These service-specific terms govern if there are any conflicts with the
&quot;General Terms&quot; or the &quot;Use Preview in a Production Environment&quot; sections.</p>

Preview terms of use, then to the extent of such inconsistency, these Preview terms of use will
control over the conflicting terms in the Agreement.</p>
