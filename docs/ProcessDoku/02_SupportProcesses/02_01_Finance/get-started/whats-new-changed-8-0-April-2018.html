[!include[rename-banner](~/includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]
<p>This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations version 8.0 (April 2018). This version was released in April 2018 and has build numbers 8.0.30 and 8.0.35.</p>
<p>To discover the latest updates to our business applications, as well as a host of new capabilities for building your own applications and extensions on top of our platform, download the <a href="/business-applications-release-notes/April18/release-overview">Dynamics 365 Spring '18 release plans</a>. The release plans provide details about the features that are either new or changed in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-dynamics-365-for-finance-and-operations">Introducing Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations</h3>
<p>Users and developers will see an updated product name, &quot;Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.&quot; With version 8.0, Microsoft is further simplifying our Dynamics 365 offerings and increasing ease of selection for our customers and ecosystem. Going forward, Microsoft is no longer offering separate editions (Business edition and Enterprise edition), so the product name for this Dynamics 365 application is Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.</p>
<h2 id="business-productivity">Business productivity</h2>
<h3 id="alerts">Alerts</h3>
<p>Client-based alert functionality enables a user to define alert rules based on business events, such as when an invoice is paid or a customer changes an address. For more information about alerts and how to create them, see <a href="alerts-overview.html">Alerts overview</a>.</p>
<h3 id="optimization-advisor">Optimization advisor</h3>
<p>Uses telemetry to analyze customers' business processes, finds optimization opportunities, uses application data to quantify the opportunities, and then recommends solutions.</p>
<h3 id="project-timesheet-mobile">Project timesheet mobile</h3>
<p>Employees can create and submit project timesheets. The use of saved favorites and the ability to copy from a previous timesheet facilitates rapid, accurate time entry.</p>
<h3 id="edit-default-project-fulfillment-hours">Edit default project fulfillment hours</h3>
<p>Project resource managers can edit the default hours as part of the project booking fulfillment process.</p>
<h3 id="reserve-project-resources-past-the-task-end-date">Reserve project resources past the task end date</h3>
<p>Project resource managers can fulfill resources on tasks past the current planned end date for the task.</p>
<h3 id="person-search-report">Person search report</h3>
<p>You can find a person and their personal data in Finance and Operations.</p>
<h3 id="data-sharing-for-customer-and-vendor-tables">Data sharing for customer and vendor tables</h3>
<p>Data can be shared across customer and vendor tables and many related tables across multiple legal entities.</p>
<h3 id="one-voucher-deprecation">One voucher deprecation</h3>
<p>The existing functionality for financial journals (general journal, fixed asset journal, vendor payment journal, and so on) lets you enter multiple subledger transactions in the context of a single voucher. This functionality is referred to as &quot;One voucher.&quot; The One voucher functionality causes issues during settlement, tax calculation, reconciliation of a subledger to the general ledger, financial reporting, and more. Because of these issues, the One voucher functionality will be made obsolete. However, because there are functional gaps that depend on this functionality, the functionality won't become obsolete all at once. Instead, we will use the following schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Spring '18 release</strong> – The functionality will be turned off by default, through a General ledger parameter. However, you can turn the functionality on if your organization has a scenario that falls in the business scenario gaps that are listed in the One voucher documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a customer has a business scenario that doesn't require One voucher, don't turn the functionality on. We won't fix &quot;bugs&quot; in the areas that are identified in the One voucher documentation if this functionality is used.</li>
<li>Stop using One voucher for integrations into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations, unless the functionality is required for one of the functional gaps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fall '18 and later releases</strong> – The functional gaps will be filled. After the functional gaps are filled, the One voucher functionality will be permanently turned off.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="../../../finance/general-ledger/one-voucher.md">One voucher documentation</a> for detailed information about the use and deprecation of this functionality.</p>
<h2 id="extensibility-and-customization">Extensibility and customization</h2>
<h3 id="customizations-through-extensions-only">Customizations through extensions only</h3>
<p>Migrating customizations from one release to the next has been simplified by moving away from over-layering to the use of extensions.</p>

<p>Customers can submit a request to Microsoft for extension support to be added to the product for a needed scenario. In this release, this feature is moved to Lifecycle Services (LCS).</p>
<h3 id="embedding-microsoft-power-apps-in-workspaces-and-forms">Embedding Microsoft Power Apps in workspaces and forms</h3>
