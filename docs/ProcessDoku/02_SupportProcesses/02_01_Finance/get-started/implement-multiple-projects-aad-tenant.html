<h1 id="multiple-lcs-projects-and-environments-on-one-azure-ad-tenant">Multiple LCS projects and environments on one Azure AD tenant</h1>

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
<p>For any new cloud project, one Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) Implementation project is instantiated on a Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that provides access to one production instance. In rare cases, to handle the requirements of a specific implementation, you might require multiple production instances that run in parallel. By creating multiple LCS projects against the same Azure AD tenant, you can have multiple production instances. Here are the most common scenarios where multiple production instances might be required:</p>
<ul>
<li>A global implementation's requirements for data residency, latency, or data volume can't be met by one instance.</li>
<li>Different business units in an organization are implementing the product separately as independent applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Manual intervention by the Microsoft Dynamics Service Engineering (DSE) team is required in order to create additional LCS projects on a shared Azure AD tenant. This approach should be used only if a single-instance strategy truly isn't feasible. Before additional LCS projects can be created, customers must provide the business justification and confirm that they understand all the implications of the approach. This process should be started as early in the implementation lifecycle as possible. Customers who decide to proceed should open a support ticket through their existing LCS project.</p>
<h2 id="licensing-requirements">Licensing requirements</h2>
<p>Every LCS Implementation project that runs on the same Azure AD tenant must satisfy the minimum licensing requirements. For example, if there are three LCS Implementation projects on the same Azure AD tenant, a customer must purchase no less than three times the minimum number of subscription licenses. Currently, the minimum license requirement is 20 full user licenses. Therefore, to run three LCS Implementation projects on the same Azure AD tenant, the customer must purchase at least 60 licenses.</p>
<p>Because the licenses are associated with the Azure AD tenant, the <strong>Subscriptions available</strong> page for every LCS project will show the total number of licenses, even though a given LCS project can use only the portion of licenses that has been allocated to it. This allocation of license to LCS projects must be documented outside the system.</p>
<p>Users who access multiple environments in parallel must be licensed separately for each environment. A user can only be assigned one license for each product for each Azure AD tenant. This allocation of licensing requirements for LCS projects for specific users must be documented outside the system. For additional information about licensing, download the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&amp;clcid=0x409">Licensing guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-multiple-lcs-projects">Disadvantages of multiple LCS projects</h2>
<p>There are some disadvantages to having multiple LCS projects. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Master data isn't shared.</li>
<li>Intercompany transactions aren't supported.</li>
<li>Integrations must be configured in each LCS project.</li>
<li>Each LCS project requires a separate Bring your own database (BYOD) instance</li>
<li>User acceptance testing (UAT) must be done on each instance, even if the code is the same. UAT is required on each instance, because differences can occur across the LCS projects, even if they share a code base. One source of differences can be the integration setup and BYOD configuration that must be done separately in each LCS project and therefore must be tested in each LCS project. Additionally, there might be data variations, different application configurations per region might affect functionality, and different data centers might support a different set of Azure services.</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure DevOps must be configured in each LCS project. When customizations and code are shared, it makes sense to use the same Azure DevOps project.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advantages-of-multiple-lcs-projects">Advantages of multiple LCS projects</h2>
<p>There are also advantages to having multiple LCS projects. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data centers can be selected per LCS project to provide the best latency experience.</li>
<li>Data centers can be selected per LCS project to satisfy statutory requirements for data residency.</li>
<li>There is more flexibility to schedule servicing operations, such as code deployments and upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requesting-multiple-lcs-projects-on-the-same-azure-ad-tenant">Requesting multiple LCS projects on the same Azure AD tenant</h2>
<p>If your solution requires multiple LCS projects on the same Azure AD tenant, all LCS projects except the original project must be provisioned on demand by the DSE team. You should inform the DSE team about this requirement as early as possible, ideally when the project is being onboarded. For more information, see <a href="../imp-lifecycle/onboard.html">Onboard an implementation project</a>. To request additional LCS Implementation projects, the customer must create a support request by using the Support portal in LCS. In this request, the customer must provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The business justification.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The enterprise and project structure. This information includes the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the Implementation project</li>
<li>The breakdown of licenses per LCS project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Confirmation that the customer understands the implications of multiple LCS projects on the same Azure AD tenant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="online-deployments-in-china-sovereign-cloud">Online deployments in China sovereign cloud</h2>
<p>If your implementation includes China deployment/rollout, be informed that Dynamics 365 Finance online deployment became available in Mainland China starting in April 2019. For more information, see <a href="../../dev-itpro/deployment/china-local-deployment.md">Finance and Operations apps - operated by 21Vianet in China</a>. This deployment is designed to comply with regulatory requirements in China and the services  include a physically separated instance of a cloud service with a different tenant (Azure Active Directory) that is operated and transacted by 21Vianet.</p>
<p>This is a single organization in multiple clouds with different tenant (Azure Active Directory). The advantages and disadvantages of multi-Lifecycle Services projects or production environments described above are still applicable, but the licensing requirement and requesting procedure are different. Work with your Microsoft Account Executive or your implementation partners for any process assistance.</p>
