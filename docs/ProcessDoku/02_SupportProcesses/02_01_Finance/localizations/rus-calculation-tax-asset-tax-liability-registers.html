<h1 id="calculation-of-tax-asset-and-tax-liability-registers">Calculation of tax asset and tax liability registers</h1>

<p>According to Russian legislation, the accounting profit and the profit tax base are formed according to different legislation and rules. Therefore, two tax types have been developed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant tax</strong>: Differences are based on income and expenses that form the accounting profit (loss) and are excluded from the calculation of the tax base for income tax. Constant tax differences generate constant tax income (CTI) and constant tax expense (CTE).</li>
<li><strong>Temporary tax</strong>: Differences are based on deferred income tax. The tax is from when expenses or income that form the accounting profit are in one reporting period, and the tax base is in another reporting period or in other reporting periods. Temporary tax differences generate deferred tax asset (DTA) and deferred tax liability (DTL).</li>
</ul>
<p>This topic provides information about the two methods that tax registers use to calculate tax differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Balance method:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calculation of temporary tax differences by balance method</strong> tax register</li>
<li><strong>Calculation of constant tax differences by balance method</strong> tax register</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Accrual method:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calculation of temporary tax differences</strong> tax register</li>
<li><strong>Calculation of constant tax differences</strong> tax register</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">

<p>As of January 1, 2020, tax differences must be calculated by using the balance method.</p>

<ul>
<li>When the current profit tax is calculated based on accounting data, the ledger posting of temporary deferred tax should be posted in correspondence with ledger  account <strong>68.profit tax</strong>.

<li>When the current profit tax is calculated based on the profit tax declaration, the ledger posting of temporary deferred tax should be posted in correspondence with  ledger account <strong>99</strong>. In this case, there is ledger posting of constant tax differences.</li>
