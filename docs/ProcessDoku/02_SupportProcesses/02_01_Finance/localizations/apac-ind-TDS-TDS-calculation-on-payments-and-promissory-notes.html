<p>Follow these steps to calculate TDS on payments and promissory notes.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>On the journal pages, create journal lines. Select the account type and offset account type.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Functions &gt; Settlement</strong> to open the <strong>Open transaction editing</strong> page. Then select a specific invoice that must be settled. If TDS has already been calculated at the invoice level, the <strong>Amount origin</strong> field shows the base amount that the TDS was calculated on. The <strong>TDS amount</strong> field shows the TDS amount that was calculated for the transaction. The <strong>Amount</strong> field shows the net payment amount (that is, the payment amount after TDS is deducted).</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>For a payment that was made against an invoice, the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the payment amount and the invoice amount are the same, TDS isn't calculated if it has already been calculated at the invoice level.</li>
<li>If the invoice amount after the TDS amount is deducted is more than the payment amount, TDS isn't calculated.</li>
<li>If the invoice amount after the TDS amount is deducted is less than the payment amount, TDS is calculated on the amount that exceeds the invoice amount.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Journal voucher</strong> page, on the <strong>Overview</strong> tab, in the <strong>TDS groups</strong> field, review or change the default TDS group that is defined for the vendor or customer. TDS that is calculated on journal lines is based on the formula that is defined for the TDS tax codes in the TDS group.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Withholding tax amount in total</strong> – The total TDS that was calculated for the transaction for the TDS group.</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong> – The total percentage that was used to calculate TDS for the transaction. The total percentage is based on the formula that is defined for the TDS tax codes and attached to the TDS group.</li>
<li><strong>Adjusted withholding tax amount in total</strong> – The total adjusted TDS amount for all tax codes in the TDS group.</li>
<li><strong>TDS</strong> – A selected checkbox indicates that a TDS group is attached to the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fields on the <strong>Overview</strong>, <strong>General</strong>, and <strong>Adjustment</strong> tabs show the calculated TDS amount and details of the adjusted TDS amount for each TDS tax code that is attached to the TDS group.</p>
