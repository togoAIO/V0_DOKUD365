[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
<p>The National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary has announced that, starting July 1, 2018, companies in Hungary are required to supply data of their issued invoices to the Real-time invoice reporting (RTIR) platform of the Online invoicing system.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu">https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu</a>.</p>
<p>This topic describes how to set up Electronic reporting (ER) configurations, and how to set up and use electronic messaging (EM) functionality for RTIR.</p>
<p>The topic includes information about how to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import ER configurations, and set up application-specific parameters.</li>
<li>Set up EM functionality.</li>
<li>Work with EM functionality for RTIR.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="import-er-configurations">Import ER configurations</h2>

<p>Be sure to import the most recent versions of these configurations. The version description usually includes the number of the Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) article that explains the changes that were introduced in the configuration version.</p>
</div>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>After all the ER configurations from the preceding table are imported, set the <strong>Default for model mapping</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong> for the <strong>RTIR mapping</strong> and <strong>RTIR import model mapping</strong> configurations.</p>
</div>
<p>For more information about how to download ER configurations from the Microsoft global repository, see <a href="../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-download-configurations-global-repo.md">Download ER configurations from the Global repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-application-specific-parameters">Set up application-specific parameters</h2>
<p>The format that is used to report invoice data to the Hungarian Online Invoicing System requires specific values from enumerated lists for some elements (for example, units of measure or line expression indicators). For these elements, before you start to use RTIR, you must set up application-specific parameters that the <strong>RTIR Invoice Data (HU)</strong> format will use.</p>
<p>When you've finished setting up conditions, change the value of the <strong>State</strong> field to <strong>Completed</strong>, save your changes, and close the page.</p>
<h3 id="line-expression-indicator">Line expression indicator</h3>
<p>The <strong>lineExpressionIndicator</strong> element of the Boolean type must be reported to the Online invoicing system for invoice lines. For natural units of measure, a value of <strong>true</strong> must be reported for the <strong>lineExpressionIndicator</strong> element. If the unit of measure isn't indicated for an invoice line, a value of <strong>false</strong> must be reported for the <strong>lineExpressionIndicator</strong> element.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> workspace, select the most recent imported version of the <strong>RTIR Invoice Data (HU)</strong> format.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Configurations</strong> tab, in the <strong>Application specific parameters</strong> group, select <strong>Setup</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Lookups</strong> FastTab, select <strong>UnitOfMeasureTypeLookup</strong> for the most recent version of the format, and then define which units of measure must be reported as natural (that is, a value of <strong>true</strong> must be reported for the <strong>lineExpressionIndicator</strong> element in the Online invoicing system).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Match all the units in your Legal entity. For example, for kilometers, add the following line:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lookup result:</strong> Natural</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Line:</strong> 1</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Unit of measure code:</strong> km</p>
<p>This value is the value from the <strong>Units</strong> page for your legal entity (<strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Units</strong>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>At the end of the list, add the following two lines.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Lookup result</th>
<th>Line</th>
<th>Unit of measure</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NONE</td>
<td>This line must be next to last in the list</td>
<td>*Blank*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Other</td>
<td>This line must be last in the list.</td>
<td>*Not blank*</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>The <strong>lineDescription</strong> element must be reported when the <strong>lineExpressionIndicator</strong> element is reported. If there is no value for the
<strong>lineDescription</strong> element on the related line of the invoice, this element will indicate the voucher of the related invoice. We recommend that you define the description on all invoice lines of all types, except invoices that are posted from a sales order. In that case, the <strong>lineDescription</strong> element will report the item.</p>
<h3 id="unit-of-measure">Unit of measure</h3>
<p>For the <strong>unitOfMeasure</strong> element, one of the values from the enumerated list that is defined by the XSD schema of the <strong>Invoice Data</strong> format must be reported.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> workspace, select the most recent imported version of the <strong>RTIR Invoice Data (HU)</strong> format.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Configurations</strong> tab, in the <strong>Application specific parameters</strong> group, select <strong>Setup</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Lookups</strong> FastTab, select <strong>UnitOfMeasureLookup</strong> for the most recent version of the format, and then define the correspondence between the reference units of measure and the enumerated list of the Online invoicing system. For example, for kilometers, add the following line:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lookup result:</strong> KILOMETER</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Line:</strong> 1</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Unit of measure code:</strong> km</p>
<p>(This value is the value from the <strong>Units</strong> page for your legal entity.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of adding all the <strong>own</strong> values to the list, you can define <strong>*Not blank*</strong> for the <strong>OWN</strong> lookup result. All the other values will then be reported as <strong>OWN</strong>. The <strong>OWN</strong> lookup result must be added, and it must be last in the list.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>unitOfMeasureOwn</strong> element must report information about any unit of measure that there is no value for in the enumerated list of the <strong>unitOfMeasure</strong> element.

<h3 id="customer-tax-number-type">Customer tax number type</h3>
<p>As of <strong>version 94.50</strong> of the <strong>RTIR Invoice Data (HU)</strong> format, which was released to support <strong>XSD version 3.0</strong> of the Online invoicing system, you must report different types of customer tax registrations in different nodes of the report.</p>
<table>

<p>When the purchase of goods or services is completed by using a group identification number, <strong>customerTaxNumber</strong> can also be represented by <strong>groupMemberTaxNumber</strong> (the tax number of the group member).</p>
<p>To differentiate the various registration types that are specified for customers' VAT data, use the <strong>Registration categories</strong> functionality.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Global address book</strong> &gt; <strong>Registration types</strong> &gt; <strong>Registration types</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create tax registration types that you will associate with your customers' registration categories and <strong>customerVatData</strong> values for the Online invoicing system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Global address book</strong> &gt; <strong>Registration types</strong> &gt; <strong>Registration categories</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For the registration categories that you will use for your customers, specify the registration types that you just created.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> workspace, open <strong>Invoices Communication Model</strong> &gt; <strong>RTIR Invoice Data (HU)</strong>.</p>

<li><p>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Configurations</strong> tab, in the <strong>Application specific parameters</strong> group, select <strong>Setup</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the latest version of the configuration in the list on the left.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Lookups</strong> FastTab, select the <strong>TaxNumberTypeLookup</strong> field, and then, in the <strong>Tax registration types</strong> column, create a mapping between the registration types that you created in step 2. In this way, you create an association between your customers' registration categories and the values that the Online invoicing system expects for the <strong>customerVatData</strong> node in the <strong>Lookup result</strong> column on the <strong>Conditions</strong> FastTab.</p>
<p>When the setup for the <strong>TaxNumberTypeLookup</strong> lookup field is completed, the system applies the following algorithm to report the <strong>customerVatData</strong> node:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>customerVatData</strong> node is enabled if the <strong>customerVATstatus</strong> value is <em>not</em> <strong>PRIVATE_PERSON</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>customerVatData</strong> node is enabled if the <strong>customerVATstatus</strong> value is <strong>DOMESTIC</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>customerTaxNumber.groupMemberTaxNumber</strong> node is enabled if the customer has a <strong>TaxRegistrationId</strong> value that is mapped to the <strong>GROUP VAT ID</strong> value in the <strong>TaxNumberTypeLookup</strong> field.</li>
<li>The <strong>customerVatData</strong> node is enabled if the customer has a <strong>TaxRegistrationId</strong> value that is mapped to the <strong>EU VAT ID</strong> value in the <strong>TaxNumberTypeLookup</strong> field, and if the <strong>customerVATstatus</strong> value is <strong>OTHER</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>thirdStateTaxId</strong> node is enabled if the customer has a <strong>TaxRegistrationId</strong> value that is mapped to the <strong>THIRD STATE VAT ID</strong> value, and if the <strong>customerVATstatus</strong> value is <strong>OTHER</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>When you've finished setting up the lookup fields, set the <strong>State</strong> field to <strong>Completed</strong>, and then save the configuration.</p>

<p>Version 94.50 of the <strong>RTIR Invoice Data (HU)</strong> format was released to support XSD version 3.0 of the Online invoicing system. Therefore, because of the previously described changes, you must classify all the sales tax exempt codes and sales tax codes that are required for reporting to the Online invoicing system before you start to use XSD version 3.0 for reporting.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>Electronic reporting</strong> workspace, open <strong>Invoices Communication Model</strong> &gt; <strong>RTIR Invoice Data (HU)</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the Action Pane, on the <strong>Configurations</strong> tab, in the <strong>Application specific parameters</strong> group, select <strong>Setup</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the latest version of the configuration in the list on the left.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Lookups</strong> FastTab, in the <strong>VatExemptionCodesLookup</strong> field, create a mapping between the sales tax exempt codes that your company uses and the values that the Online invoicing system expects for the <strong>vatExemption</strong> node in the <strong>Lookup result</strong> column on the <strong>Conditions</strong> FastTab.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>VatOutOfScopeCodesLookup</strong> lookup field, define the mapping between the sales tax codes that your company uses and the values that XSD version 3.0 of the Online invoicing system expects in the <strong>vatExemption</strong> node in the <strong>Lookup result</strong> column on the <strong>Conditions</strong> FastTab.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>MarginSchemeTypesLookup</strong> lookup field, define the mapping between the sales tax codes that your company uses and the values that XSD version 3.0 of the Online invoicing system expects in the <strong>marginSchemeIndicator</strong> node in the <strong>Lookup result</strong> column on the <strong>Conditions</strong> FastTab.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>VatRateTypesLookup</strong> lookup field, define the mapping between the sales tax codes that your company uses and the values that XSD version 3.0 of the Online invoicing system expects in the <strong>vatPercentage</strong> and <strong>vatExemption</strong> nodes in the <strong>Lookup result</strong> column on the <strong>Conditions</strong> FastTab.</p>
<p>This setup must be completed for all your sales tax codes.</p>

<h2 id="import-a-package-of-data-entities-that-includes-a-predefined-em-setup">Import a package of data entities that includes a predefined EM setup</h2>
<p>EM functionality is provided to maintain different electronic reporting processes for different document types. For more information about electronic messages, see <a href="../general-ledger/electronic-messaging.html">Electronic messaging</a>.</p>
<p>The process of setting up the EM functionality for RTIR has many steps. Because the names of some predefined entities are used in the ER configurations, it's important that you use a set of predefined values that are delivered in a package of data entities for the related tables.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In <a href="https://lcs.dynamics.com/v2">LCS</a>, go to the Shared asset library, and select the <strong>Data package</strong> asset type.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the list of data package files, find <strong>HU RTIR setup.zip</strong>, and download it to your computer. There might be several versions of the package. Be sure to download the most recent version.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After the HU RTIR setup.zip file is downloaded, open Finance, select the company that you will interoperate with the Hungarian Online invoicing system from, and then go to <strong>Workspaces</strong> &gt; <strong>Data management</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Data management</strong> workspace, go to <strong>Framework parameters</strong> &gt; <strong>Entity settings</strong>, and then select <strong>Refresh entity list</strong>. Wait for confirmation that the refresh has been completed. For more information about how to refresh the entity list, see <a href="../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities.md#entity-list-refresh">Entity list refresh</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Validate that the source data and target data are correctly mapped. For more information, see the section about validation in <a href="../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-import-export-job.md#validate-that-the-source-data-and-target-data-are-mapped-correctly">Data import and export jobs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Before the data entities are used for the first time to import the data from the package, sync the mapping of source data and target data. In the list for the package, select a data entity, and then, on the Action Pane, select <strong>Modify target mapping</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Above the grid for the package, select <strong>Generate mapping</strong> to create a mapping from scratch, and then save the mapping.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 6 through 7 for each data entity in the package before you start the import.</p>
<p>For more information about data management, see <a href="../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-entities-data-packages.md">Data management</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must now import data from the HU RTIR setup.zip file into the selected company. In the <strong>Data management</strong> workspace, select <strong>Import</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Upload and add</strong>, select the <strong>HU RTIR setup.zip</strong> file on your computer, and upload it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After the data entities are uploaded, on the Action Pane, select <strong>Import</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="media/1_Setup_EM.png" alt="Data management workspace."></p>
<p>You will receive a notification in <strong>Messages</strong>, or you can manually refresh the page to view the data import progress. When the import process is completed, the <strong>Execution summary</strong> page shows the results.</p>
<p>The HU RTIR setup.zip package provides the setup for <strong>Online invoicing</strong> processing in the EM functionality that supports interoperation with the Hungarian Online invoicing system. The following illustration shows the schema for <strong>Online invoicing</strong> processing.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-financial-reasons-for-rtir">Set up financial reasons for RTIR</h2>
<p>For each invoice that is reported to the Hungarian Online invoicing system, a specific operation type must be defined and transmitted in the <strong>&lt;invoiceOperation&gt;</strong> element in the <strong>ManageInvoiceRequest.xml</strong> file. In most cases, Finance automatically specifies the invoice operation type according to the rules that are defined in requirements of the Hungarian Online invoicing system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create</strong> – This invoice operation type is specified when Finance defines no reference to original invoice.</li>
<li><strong>Modify</strong> – This invoice operation type is specified when Finance defines a reference to original invoice.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can manually define the operation type for an invoice during invoice posting by using the <strong>Financial reasons</strong> page.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Financial reasons</strong>. In the <strong>Operation</strong> column, define operation types. The following values are allowed by the Hungarian Online invoicing system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create</strong> – The invoice in the given position is considered an original invoice.</li>
<li><strong>Modify</strong> – The invoice is a modifying invoice.</li>
<li><strong>Storno</strong> – The invoice is a canceling invoice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By using the related financial reason during invoice posting, you can have a specific operation type reported for an invoice.</p>
<p>For example, you want to submit an invoice of the <strong>Storno</strong> operation type to the Online invoicing system. For this invoice, specify a financial reason that has a value of <strong>Storno</strong> value in <strong>Operation</strong> field. To submit a corrective invoice that has no reference to the original invoice, specify a financial reason that has a value of <strong>Modify</strong> in the <strong>Operation</strong> field.</p>
<h2 id="rtir-process">RTIR process</h2>

<h3 id="reporting-advance-payment-invoices-and-final-invoices">Reporting advance payment invoices and final invoices</h3>
<p>As of XSD version 3.0, the Online invoicing system requires a specific application to report advance payment invoices and final invoices. For detailed information about the requirements, see the <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The following business process is considered a subject for the &quot;Advance payment invoices and final invoices&quot; reporting scenario. According to the Hungarian VAT Act, <em>receipt of advance payment is a tax point</em>. In the general business scenario that involves advance payment invoices and final invoices, the following events occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>The supplier issues a request for advance payment. This request is a non-VAT document.</li>
<li>After the payment is made by the customer and received by the supplier, the supplier issues an invoice for the advance payment.</li>
<li>The final invoice is issued upon fulfillment of the supply. This invoice considers the amount of the advance payment. The VAT amount is payable on the total consideration reduced by the advance payments.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Dynamics 365 Finance's solution for Hungarian Online invoicing system supports reporting of described below scenarios of &quot;Advance payment invoices and final invoices&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-1-a-prepayment-that-has-sales-tax-transactions-is-posted-accounts-receivable-module">Scenario 1: A prepayment that has sales tax transactions is posted (Accounts receivable module)</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>Post a prepayment that has sales tax transactions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Advance invoices</strong> &gt; <strong>All advance invoices</strong>, and create an advance invoice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Advance invoice</strong> page, on the Action Pane, select <strong>Related information</strong> &gt; <strong>Prepayment</strong> to link the posted prepayment to the advance payment that you just created.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Post the advance invoice. No voucher is created. Therefore, there is no effect on the accounting.</p>
<p>The posted advance invoice is reported to the Online invoicing system. Lines are collected from the sales tax transactions of the prepayment that is linked to the advance invoice. The invoice number and date information are collected from the advance invoice header. The currency amount and exchange rate of the advance invoice are reported in the currency of the posted prepayment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Accounts receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Advance invoices</strong> &gt; <strong>All advance invoices</strong>, and create a final invoice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Advance invoice</strong> page, on the Action Pane, select <strong>Related information</strong> &gt; <strong>Prepayment</strong>, and link the final invoice to the advance invoice that you created earlier.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>To ensure correct reporting in the Online invoicing system, avoid linking multiple invoices to multiple advance invoices on the same sales order.</p>
</div>
<p>The posted final invoice is reported to the Online invoicing system. It includes reference information in the <strong>&lt;advancePaymentData&gt;</strong> node and amounts in summary reduced by the posted sales tax from prepayments that are linked to the same advance invoice.

<h3 id="support-for-archiving-digital-invoices-and-including-the-hash-value-on-the-data-report">Support for archiving digital invoices and including the hash value on the data report</h3>
<p>As of XSD version 3.0, the Online invoicing system supports archiving digital invoices and sending the hash numbers that it generates for those invoices. To enable your system to generate hash numbers for the invoices, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Workspaces</strong> &gt; <strong>Feature management</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Feature management</strong> workspace, find and select the <strong>Archive printed customer invoices with hash numbers</strong> feature, and turn it on.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Organization administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Document management</strong> &gt; <strong>Document management parameters</strong>, and set up the archive directory.</li>
<li>Specify the customers and project invoices that must be archived. Open the <strong>Customer</strong> page for each customer, select <strong>Invoice and delivery</strong> &gt; <strong>eInvoice</strong>, and then set the <strong>eInvoice attachment</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information, see <a href="../accounts-receivable/archive-printed-invoices.html">Archive printed customer invoices with hash numbers</a>.</p>
<p>After you've finished, any posted and printed invoices for the specified customers will have an attachment where the <strong>Type</strong> field is set to <strong>File</strong> and the <strong>Restriction</strong> field is set to <strong>External</strong>. To review attachments, select <strong>Document handling</strong>. The <strong>General</strong> FastTab of the <strong>Document handling</strong> page shows the hash number that is related to an invoice. If an attachment that was created for an invoice has a hash number, when the invoice is reported to the Online invoicing system, it will include the hash number value that is stored in the system.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>To ensure correct reporting of system data in the Online invoicing system, create one credit note for each invoice. Avoid scenarios where one credit note is created for multiple invoices.</p>
