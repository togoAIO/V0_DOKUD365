<h2 id="introduction-to-tds">Introduction to TDS</h2>
<p>Per the Income tax Act, 1961, income tax is deducted at the source by the receiver of the service at the time of advance payment or accounting of credit, whichever occurs first. The person who makes the payment must deduct the tax amount and pay only the net balance to the provider of the service. TDS is applied on services that the government specifies, and the tax is deducted by using the rates that the government specifies for a period. The rate of deduction is based on the status of the entity that receives the payment or provides the service. Statuses include <strong>Individual</strong>, <strong>Hindu Undivided Family</strong> (<strong>HUF</strong>), <strong>Company</strong>, <strong>Firm</strong>, <strong>Association of Persons</strong> (<strong>AOP</strong>), <strong>Body of Individuals</strong> (<strong>BOI</strong>), and <strong>Local authority</strong>.</p>

<p>TDS is calculated on purchases, sales, sales returns, credit notes, fixed asset acquisitions, prepayments, advance payments, promissory notes, works tax, and intercompany transactions.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In the current Indian tax scenario, TDS isn't calculated on sales transactions. However, the system includes a provision to calculate TDS recoverable on sales transactions, especially for intercompany transactions.</p>
</div>
<p>The calculation of TDS always considers the threshold and the exception threshold that are defined for the TDS component.</p>
<p>The periodic TDS settlement process must be run, and the TDS payments must be settled to TDS authority vendors.</p>
<p>The certificate numbers and dates for TDS certificates that are received from vendors or customers can be recorded and updated. Additionally, Form 26Q and Form 27Q quarterly statements, and the Form 16A certificate for TDS, can be generated in Finance.</p>
