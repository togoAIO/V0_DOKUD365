[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]
<p>This topic provides information about the tax registers for receivables, hopeless debts, and their write-off.</p>
<p>Accounts receivable are formed based on outstanding invoices and advances that have been issued. Accounts receivable are considered <em>bad</em> if they aren't repaid within the period that was agreed on in the contract. <em>Hopeless debts</em> are debts that can be written off. An example is a debt that lasts more than three years.</p>
<p>The amounts of bad and hopeless debts are identified during the inventory of accounts receivable and are included in the allowance for bad debts reserve. The inventory is done on the end date of the previous tax period.</p>
<p>The bad debts reserve for profit tax accounting purposes is formed based on the number of days that the payment period is exceeded by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fewer than 45 days</strong>: Arrears aren't included in the reserve.</li>
<li><strong>Between 45 and 90 days</strong>: The reserve amount is 50 percent of the outstanding amount.</li>
<li><strong>More than 90 days</strong>: The reserve amount is 100 percent of the outstanding amount.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of the reserve for profit tax accounting can't exceed 10 percent of the revenue for the reporting tax period. This amount is adjusted for the reserve balance of the previous period:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the amount of the current quarter's reserve is less than the amount of the previous quarter's reserve balance, the difference is included in non-operating income when the reserve amount for the reporting period is formed.</li>
<li>If the amount of the current quarter's reserve is more than the amount of the previous quarter's reserve balance, the difference is included in non-operating expenses when the reserve amount for the reporting period is formed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad debts reserve can be used to cover only hopeless debts:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the reserve amount is more than the amount of hopeless debts that are written off, the difference is transferred to the next reporting period.</li>
<li>If the reserve amount is less than the amount of hopeless debts that are written off, the difference is included in non-operating expenses that reduce the taxable base of profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following tax registers provide information about accounts receivable and calculate the bad debts reserve in profit tax accounting and business accounting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tax registers for the inventory of accounts receivable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts receivable inventory act</li>
<li>Accounts receivable inventory act (business accounting)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Tax registers for calculating the bad debts reserve in accounts receivable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts receivable - bad debts reserve</li>
<li>Accounts receivable - reserve (business accounting)</li>
<li>Accounts receivable - reserve details</li>
<li>Accounts receivable - reserve details (business accounting)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Tax registers for collecting information about the movement of the bad debts reserve in accounts receivable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts receivable - bad debt reserve movement</li>
<li>Accounts receivable - reserve movement (business accounting)</li>
<li>Accounts receivable - reserve movement details</li>
<li>Accounts receivable - reserve movement details (business accounting)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Tax registers for collecting information about the movement of accounts receivable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts receivable movement</li>
<li>Accounts receivable movement (business accounting)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you manually calculate tax registers one by one, consider using the following sequences for tax register calculation. If you calculate all tax registers together for the period, these sequences will automatically be used.</p>
<p>When you create the tax register journal for the current period, you should assume that the tax registers for the previous period were calculated in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the end of the previous period, a tax register for the inventory of accounts receivable should have been calculated.</li>
<li>At the end of the previous period, a tax register for the calculation of the bad debts reserve in accounts receivable should have been calculated, based on the tax register for the inventory of accounts receivable. This register is the bad debts reserve for both the current period and future periods.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you calculate tax registers for the current period, consider the following sequence of steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>During the current period, run the write -off procedure for some debts that were recognized as hopeless before the end of the previous period, or that became hopeless during the current period.</li>
<li>Based on the information at the end of the previous period, and all operations during the current period, calculate the tax register by collecting information about the movement of accounts receivable.</li>
<li>Calculate the tax register by collecting information about the movement of the bad debts reserve in accounts receivable. This register contains all the information about the movement and use of the reserve that was calculated at the end of the previous period.</li>
<li>At the end of the current period, calculate the tax register for the inventory of accounts receivable. This register represents the status of all accounts receivable.</li>
<li>At the end of the current period, calculate the tax register for the calculation of the bad debts reserve in accounts receivable. This register is the bad debts reserve for future periods.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<h3 id="create-and-set-up-two-debts-calculation-models">Create and set up two debts calculation models</h3>
<p>Debts can be calculated for profit tax accounting purposes and business accounting reports. Create two models, one for business accounting and one for tax accounting.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Profit tax</strong> &gt; <strong>Debts calculation models</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the Action Pane, select <strong>New</strong> to create the first of the two models.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Model number</strong> field, enter the short name of the model. For example, name the model for business accounting <strong>RAP</strong> and the model for tax accounting <strong>TAX</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Description</strong> field, enter a detailed description of the model. For example, enter <strong>Business accounting</strong> for the <strong>RAP</strong> model and <strong>Tax accounting</strong> for the <strong>TAX</strong> model.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, set the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Period types</strong> field, select the calculation period. For example, select <strong>Months</strong> for the <strong>RAP</strong> model and <strong>Quarters</strong> for the <strong>TAX</strong> model.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Accounting policy</strong> field, select <strong>Accounting object</strong> or <strong>Total</strong>.</li>
<li>Leave the <strong>Reserve limit sequence</strong> field set to <strong>0</strong> (zero). You will configure the sequence later.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>Reserve limit on the period adjustment</strong> option to <strong>Yes</strong> to apply the reserve limit only to the revenue adjustment for the current reporting period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If you chose <strong>Accounting object</strong> in the <strong>Accounting policy</strong> section (for example, for <strong>RAP</strong>), on the <strong>Customer posting</strong> and <strong>Vendor posting</strong> FastTab, set up the ledger accounts and expense/income codes for the bad debts reserves posting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Account code</strong> field, select <strong>Table</strong>, <strong>Group</strong>, or <strong>All</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Account/Group number</strong> field, select the customer or vendor account number if you selected <strong>Table</strong> in the <strong>Account code</strong> field. If you selected <strong>Group</strong> in the <strong>Account code</strong> field, select the customer or vendor group number.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Unrealized losses account</strong> field, select the ledger account to use to post losses in transactions on bad debts. For example, select account <strong>91 non-operating income and expenses</strong> for the <strong>RAP</strong> model and account <strong>Н91 non-operating income and expenses in TAX</strong> for the <strong>TAX</strong> model.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Unrealized income account</strong> field, select the ledger account to use to post income in transactions on bad debts. For example, select account <strong>91 non-operating income and expenses</strong> for the <strong>RAP</strong> model and account <strong>Н91 off-balance sheet account for income</strong> for the <strong>TAX</strong> model.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Bad debts reservation account</strong> field, select the ledger account to use to form the bad debts reserve. For example, select account <strong>63 reserves for bad debts</strong> for the <strong>RAP</strong> model and account <strong>Н63 reserves for bad debts for TAX</strong> for the <strong>TAX</strong> model.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Expense code</strong> field, select the expense code to link to the transaction for creating the bad debts reserve and writing off hopeless debts.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Income code</strong> field, select the income code to link to the transaction for including the bad debts reserve in non-operation income.</li>
<li>For the <strong>TAX</strong> model only: In the <strong>Summary account</strong> field, select the ledger account to use to offset the account that you selected in the <strong>Bad debts reservation account</strong> field to write off bad debt transactions. For example, select account <strong>Н62 off-balance sheet account for account receivable</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>For the <strong>RAP</strong> model, the ledger account from the customer posting profile is used for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="media/rus-bad-debts-1.png" alt="Creating models on the Debts calculation models page."></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you selected <strong>Total</strong> in the <strong>Accounting policy</strong> field, you complete the setup on the <strong>General</strong> FastTab instead of the <strong>Customer posting</strong> and <strong>Vendor posting</strong> FastTabs. Set the <strong>Unrealized losses account</strong>, <strong>Unrealized income account</strong>, <strong>Bad debts reservation account</strong>, <strong>Expense code</strong>, <strong>Income code</strong>, and
<strong>Summary account</strong> fields as described in the preceding substeps.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Debt interval</strong> FastTab, set up the percentage that is used to calculate the bad debts reserve, depending on the number of overdue days:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Period debt type</strong> field, specify <strong>Hopeless</strong>, and then select <strong>Add</strong> to create a bad debts interval.</li>
<li>In the <strong>From</strong> field, enter the lower limit of the debt interval, in days, for the current line. The <strong>Days</strong> and <strong>Register</strong> fields are automatically filled in.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Percent</strong> field, specify the percentage of debt that is included in the reserve for the current line.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Description</strong> field, enter a detailed description of the debt interval.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following illustration shows an example of the setup for a debt interval. For debts that are more than 70 days overdue, the reserve is calculated as 100 percent. For debts that are overdue between 50 and 70 days, the reserve is calculated as 80 percent. For debts that are overdue by fewer than 50 days, no reserve is calculated.</p>
<p><img src="media/rus-bad-debts-2.png" alt="Debt interval setup for a model on the Debts calculation models page."></p>

<p>These registers reflect the balance of accounts receivable at the end of the reporting period. Accounts receivable are formed based on outstanding customer invoices and advances that are issued to vendors. All outstanding invoices are divided into categories that are defined on the <strong>Debt interval</strong> FastTab of the <strong>Debts calculation models</strong> page. The difference in days between the inventory date and the invoice due date determines the excess of the debt repayment period.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows an example of the <strong>Accounts receivable inventory act</strong> page.</p>
<p><img src="media/rus-bad-debts-6.png" alt="Example of the Accounts receivable inventory act page."></p>
<p>For each register line, you can review the information in the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Line number</strong></li>
<li><strong>Accounting object</strong> – The number of the customer invoice or vendor prepayment.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction date</strong> – The date of the document that is shown in the <strong>Accounting object</strong> column.</li>
<li><strong>Dead line</strong> – The date that the debt must be repaid by.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude from reserve</strong> – A selected checkbox indicates that the document is excluded from reserve calculation. You can change this value by selecting <strong>Edit</strong> on the Action Pane. In that case, you must recalculate the dependent registers.</li>

<p>These registers reflect the amount of the reserve that is calculated for the current reporting period, based on the information in tax registers for the inventory of accounts receivable. The <strong>Reserve</strong> column shows the reserve amount . This reserve will be used in the future to write off hopeless debts.</p>
<p>The <strong>Reminder</strong> column shows the reserve balance for the previous period. The value is taken from the tax registers for collecting information about the movement of the bad debts reserve in accounts receivable. If the column is blank, the balance is considered to be <strong>0</strong> (zero). The <strong>Expense</strong> and <strong>Revenue</strong> columns show the difference between the calculated reserve for the current reporting period and the balance of the previous period. This difference is later posted to the ledger accounts for non-operating income or non-operating expenses.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows an example of the <strong>Accounts receivable- reserve details</strong> page.</p>

<p>These registers summarize information about operations for the movement of receivables to identify the amounts of bad debts (so that a reserve can be formed) and hopeless debts (so that they can be accounted as part of expenses).</p>
<p>The registers reflect all facts about the occurrence, payment, or write-off of accounts receivable from the beginning of the tax period to the reporting date. The amounts of overpayments to budgets of different levels aren't reflected in these registers.</p>
<p>For transactions in foreign currencies, records are also made for each revaluation of debt when reports are prepared.</p>
