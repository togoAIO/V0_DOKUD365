<h1 id="general-process-description">General process description</h1>

<p>The internal request is a request-form that allows sales to submit questions regarding e.g. price, delivery time, item number or general technical questions to the support groups. It is intended to have the clarification right in the ERP-System and over company borders. The clear advantages are e.g. that the manufacturing subsidiary can provide the sales subsidiary with an item number, price, etc. that is fully clarified and ready to order for the end customer in every related system. Also certain BI measurements are setup so that the clarification process can be measured and evaluated.</p>

<p>For sales an internal request is necessary, when…</p>
<ul>
<li>you need an item no., price or delivery time for an item that has a modelcode with freetext or is without modelcoding</li>
<li>the support of the CoE wants you to create an internal request</li>
<li>you need information on price or delivery time</li>
<li>you have a DC5 item</li>
<li>you need a customer specific DIAL layout or customer logo</li>
<li>you need a clarified item no. for a BOM</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need an internal request, when…</p>
<ul>
<li>you are sure, that you have an item no. with current price and delivery time from the CoE and you know that this is valid, either by a different IR or by information from the CoE that you can refer to.</li>
<li>you know that when you call the CoE, you can get to the rest of the mentioned information, like price, delivery time and item number immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-create-an-internal-request-from-crm-quotation-line-and-sales-order-line">How to create an Internal Request from CRM, Quotation Line and Sales Order Line</h2>
<p>Start from the CRM cockpit, when you have a general question, not regarding a specific item number or modelcode. However, if your IR is about a BOM item, which you want to use in your production, you need to create an IR from the CRM. Here you need to use the product clarification side, to insert an item number.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>When creating an IR from the CRM, you have to take care of the routing of the IR on your own.</p>
</div>
<p>Start from the Quotation Line or Sales Order Line, when you have a question regarding the item number, modelcode, price or delivery time. When providing a modelcode, just a ZT-Number or even an item number, your IR should be routed automatically.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In most cases, please try to provide at least a ZT-Number and if you have a modelcode, please try to code it as far as possible. This improves the routing and helps the support with the clarification.</p>
</div>
<p>To create an internal request choose this options from the <em>functions</em>-button from <em>Quotation line, Sales Order line or CRM Cockpit</em></p>
<h2 id="how-to-fill-the-internal-request-form">How to fill the Internal Request form</h2>

<ul>
<li>CoE<br>While the CoE is taken from the item master IR responsibility field (Fallback: Division) that you provided through the sales order or quotation, you need to make sure, that it is the right CoE, that you want to take care of.</li>
<li>Editor<br>Leave this field empty, unless you really want a specific person to take of the IR or you are asked by the specific support.</li>
<li>Due date<br>This date is automatically set to “Today”. However, you should provide a specific date were you want the internal request to be solved.</li>
<li>Sales information<br>Annual demand and Target price are mandatory, as soon as you want a special price. The sales quantity and Currency are automatically filled through your references line.</li>
<li>Detail question<br>Click the add button and add your question. This text will always be inserted from the top and can’t be deleted later on.<br>When you send IRs to the CoE, make sure that your question is always stated in ENGLISH only, unless you have an agreement with the receiving CoE.</li>
<li>Drag and drop<br>After attaching files, make sure to provide more file specific information in the documents tab</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ready for processing</strong> is used, when…</p>
<ul>
<li>you are a sales person within a sales subsidiary and you have a 1st level support in place, who checks the internal requests, before they are sent out to the manufacturing subsidiary (CoE)</li>
<li>you are a sales person within the manufacturing subsidiary and you want to forward it to the internal department</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Send to CoE</strong> is used, when…</p>
<ul>
<li>you are a sales person within a sales subsidiary and you don’t have a 1st level support in place and you want to send the IR directly to the manufacturing subsidiaries CoE</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The <strong>Send to CoE</strong> functionality is only available, if the vendor on the item is enabled for internal request receiving, or if you don’t have an item number (coming from the CRM), your division is enabled for IR sending.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="how-to-check-the-receiver-of-the-internal-request">How to check the receiver of the Internal Request</h2>
<p>When using the Send to CoE functionality, you can check were the IR will go to beforehand.</p>
<p>When…</p>
<ul>
<li>coming from the CRM without an item number, the IR will use the DUNS number behind the division. The flag <strong>Internal request sending available</strong> sets the availability of the <strong>Send to CoE</strong> button</li>
<li>coming from the Quotation Line or Sales Order Line, and you have an item number in your IR, the IR will use the DUNS number behind the vendor of your item.

</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-get-a-wrongly-forwarded-ir-back-callback">How to get a wrongly forwarded IR back, &quot;Callback&quot;</h2>
<p>If you have accidentally sent the IR to the wrong subsidiary or you forgot to add some information, use the Callback functionality to get the IR back to your site.</p>
<p>Since the local 1st level support and Sales can both trigger the <strong>Callback</strong> the notification will always go to both, when you pull an IR back from the subsidiary. Also, if someone in the subsidiary, where the IR has been sent to, was already on the IR, the notification will be sent to them as well (X_REQ).</p>

<p>When creating an IR, the division or item used, provides usually the best guess for the target subsidiary. However, you can bump into issues, where the picked subsidiary from the system is not correct and then you have to forward your IR to a different subsidiary.</p>
<p>In case your IR is solved, reopen your IR first.</p>
<p>Internal Request -&gt; Update -&gt; Reopen</p>
<p>Then check your leading reference of the IR.</p>
<p>Internal Request -&gt; Inquiries -&gt; Reference</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case 1: Your reference is a quotation line or sales order line</strong>
When creating your IR, you must have provided an item number or ZT-Number with Modelcode on your e.g. quotation line. This item has a vendor behind it, which is the target subsidiary of the IR, because it is also the subsidiary where you would order this item from.
However, when you state your question in your IR, for the actual Item you want to have, this particular item you requested could be manufactured at a completely different subsidiary. In these cases, the CoE will tell you, that a different subsidiary is responsible for your specific item and also name this subsidiary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you have to use a differen item number or ZT-Number in your quotation line. You can change the item on your quotation line with either the Function &gt; Replace Item, or by going into the modelcoding &gt; Select Items and picking a different ZT-Number. You need to pick an item or ZT-Number, which has the vendor set to the subsidiary, you want the IR to go to.</p>
<p>If no number with this vendor is available, it could be, that you need to create a local ZT-Number to solve this.</p>

<p>The division on the Item or in the IR has in this case no influence on the target subsidiary of the IR. Here the division only defines where the IR goes to within the target subsidiary.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case 2: Your reference is a business relation</strong>
In this case, you created the IR from the CRM Cockpit. Here you entered a division manually. Behind some divisions like “PI-PR”, there is a DUNS number setup, pointing to the subsidiary. For e.g. “PI-PR” this subsidiary is Klingenberg, while for e.g. “PI-PR (SGF)” it is SGF in Poland. Here you only have to change the division and the target subsidiary is changed, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>At last, you can now resend your IR to the right subsidiary</p>

<p>If you have a Quotation line or Sales Order Line with an solved IR, you might have similar clarifications within the same Outation or Sales Order. After you had an IR were the clarification was very similar and resulted e.g. in the same prices and lead times, but different modelcodes, you can use the assign functionality. With this, your other “unclarified” lines will have a clarified IR behind them, that helps you to know, how you got to the certain price or delivery time. Also, when transmitted via B2B, this information will be helpful.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-the-leading-reference-on-your-internal-request-and-delete-quotation-lines">How to set the leading reference on your internal request and delete quotation lines</h2>
<p>In some cases it can be necessary to set the leading reference of your IR to a different one. This occurs e.g. when you create a quotation line and solve have the IR solved. If you try to delete this line with the IR, you get the following message.</p>
<p>The effort that is contained within the IR doesn’t allow the deletion of the line. Therefor this effort has to be assigned to a new line e.g. line 20. You do this, by assigning line 20 to the IR of line 10. Then you need to jump to the References form of the IR and use the <strong>Set leading reference</strong> functionality for line 20.</p>
<p>Afterwards you shouldn’t have any issues deleting line 10.</p>

<h2 id="message-exclusive-item">Message Exclusive item</h2>
<p>When you try to insert an exclusive item as support into the IRs product clarification page, you manually have to check, if the item is appropriate for the endcustomer to order.
This may result in you sending the IR back as <strong>Callback</strong> and then trying to clarify the issue</p>
