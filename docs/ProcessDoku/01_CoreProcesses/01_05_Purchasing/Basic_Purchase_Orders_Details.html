<h2 id="creating-the-order-head">Creating The Order Head</h2>
<p>Normally, orders are generated by converting a planned order into a purchase order. But there are still processes requiring a purchase order being generated without having planned order proposals in the Material Planning cockpit.</p>
<h3 id="access-purchase-ledger-area---common-forms---purchase-order-details">Access: Purchase ledger area -&gt; Common forms -&gt; Purchase order details</h3>
<p>To create a new purchase order press <em>Crtl + N</em> or the <em>New</em> button in the top left corner of the form. The “create purchase order” form opens.</p>
<p><img src="../../media/Purchasing/Purchase_order_details_2_5_1.png" alt="Overview tab" title="Overview tab"></p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">

</div>
<h3 id="selection-of-the-vendor">Selection of the vendor</h3>

<h2 id="creating-the-order-lines">Creating the order lines</h2>
<p>To create a new purchase order line press <em>Crtl + N</em> or the <em>New</em> button in the top left corner of the form. It is important to select the “Positions” tab in the line part of the form before pressing the <em>New</em> button. If the tab is not selected, a new order head will be generated.</p>
<h3 id="selecting-an-item">Selecting an item</h3>
<p>The new order lines are numbered. The first order line is set 10 and the following lines are numbered in steps of ten (20, 30, …). It is possible to generate inclined positions numbered with interim numbers (e.g. 11, 15, …).

It is important again to select the “Positions” tab in the line part of the form before pressing the <em>New</em> button. If the tab is not selected, a new order head will be generated.</p>

<h3 id="required-information-in-the-tab-general">Required information in the tab &quot;General&quot;</h3>
<p>The fields of the tab “General” are filled in by the order information and are forwarded to the vendor via B2B.</p>
