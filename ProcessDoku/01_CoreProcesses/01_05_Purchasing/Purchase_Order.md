# Explanation of the purchase order form

## Creating The Order Head
Normally, orders are generated by converting a planned order into a purchase order. But there are still processes requiring a purchase order being generated without having planned order proposals in the Material Planning cockpit.

### Access: Purchase ledger area -> Common forms -> Purchase order details
To create a new purchase order press *Crtl + N* or the *New* button in the top left corner of the form. The “create purchase order” form opens.

![Overview tab](./../../media/Purchasing/purchase_order_details_2_5_1.png "Overview tab")

> [!Important]
> The tab “Overview” in the head area of the form has to be selected to create a new purchase order. If the area is not selected, a new line for an existing order will be created

### Selection of the vendor
The vendor can be selected by using the drop down menu in the “create purchase order” from or by typing in the 8-digit vendor id.

### Delivery date
The favored delivery date can be selected by using the calendar function or by typing in the date (dd.mm.yyyy).

### Alternative delivery address
If the delivery address differs from the main vendor address, the alternative address can be entered in the delivery address area. Afterwards the *OK* button has to be pressed.

### Texts
To add important notes for the vendor to the purchase order, the button *Texts* has to be pressed. In the “Text” form, it is possible to enter special notes for the head or the line part of the order.

The new purchase order has been created.

## Creating the order lines
To create a new purchase order line press *Crtl + N* or the *New* button in the top left corner of the form. It is important to select the “Positions” tab in the line part of the form before pressing the *New* button. If the tab is not selected, a new order head will be generated.

### Selecting an item
The new order lines are numbered. The first order line is set 10 and the following lines are numbered in steps of ten (20, 30, …). It is possible to generate inclined positions numbered with interim numbers (e.g. 11, 15, …).
The item number can be selected by using the filter function or by selecting the number from the drop down menu. 
After the number has been selected, the following fields are filled in automatically:
* Revision index
* Revision index last order
* Quantity(=min order quantity)
* Unit
* Gross unit
* Unit price
* Net amount
* Coverage group

### Creating additional order lines
To create a second or third purchase order line, press *Crtl + N* or the *New* button in the top left corner of the form. It is important again to select the “Positions” tab in the line part of the form before pressing the *New* button. If the tab is not selected, a new order head will be generated.

The line 20 is generated after having pressed the button. The selection of the item has to be processed as de-scribed above.

To generate an inclined position between line 10 and line 20, the line number has to be corrected manually.

### Required information in the tab "General"

### Required information in the tab "Price/Discount"

### Charges on head level
Using the button *Setup -> Misc. charges*, all charges concerning the complete order can be entered.

The misc. charges code can be chosen from the drop down menu. The transaction text is filled in automatically. It is important not to select any charges, being effectual on line level (e.g. alloy surcharges). Only charges being effectual on head level shall be selected.

The category as well as the misc. charges value has to be entered and confirmed by pressing the *Save* button.
