<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="34">This topic provides answers to frequently asked questions about Electronic Invoicing service. Electronic invoicing extends the electronic invoicing capabilities that exist in Dynamics 365 Finance, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, and Dynamics 365 Project Operations.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-important-about-electronic-invoicing-and-why-should-it-matter-to-my-organization" sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">What is important about electronic invoicing and why should it matter to my organization?</h2>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">Operational complexity and risk continue to intensify as organizations grow globally and expand their footprints across regions. Maintaining compliance and adapting to frequently changing regulations is a growing challenge and is of particular importance when it comes to invoicing. Invoicing has traditionally been expensive and prone to errors as companies rely on paper documents and manually intensive processes.  </p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">Organizations have begun to move away from paper invoices to reduce cost and speed up the end-to-end process. Governments are increasingly turning to electronic invoicing as a key component of tax digitalization. By requiring organizations to digitally submit real-time tax information to tax authorities, governments can minimize tax evasion and manipulation, and reduce fraud. </p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="42">The world is shifting to paperless document processing and without implementing electronic invoicing, customers may risk compliance issues, unnecessary costs, and lag behind competitors. </p>

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="66">The files attached to the electronic invoice are handled as embedded binary data in an XML element.

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">If the electronic invoicing format for your country/region isn't listed, the platform aims to support this scenario in the future. You can still benefit from the configuration capabilities Electronic invoicing has, and configure the electronic invoicing format by yourself, or you can work with a partner/ISV to configure those for your organization.</p>

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="90">Integration with Electronic Invoicing service requires at least a Tier 2 virtual machine to host Finance or Supply Chain Management.

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">This can be achieved by configuration. To test invoice submission, you can connect to Finance or Supply Chain Management from a User Acceptance Test (UAT) environment and submit the test invoices. Electronic invoicing supports configuring test digital certificates, and in the case of e-invoices requiring digital approval, the setup of a URL from test web services published by the tax authorities.</p>

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="102">Yes. The electronic invoicing features can be consumed to process business document submissions independent from the country of the legal entity, if the following is true:</p>

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="109">Yes. The same designer tools that are used in the Electronic reporting (ER) module in Finance and Supply Chain Management are used to create and configure data model mapping and file format configurations.

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="113">Yes. The applicability rules are fully configurable.

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="117">You can use other ER format configurations to produce the desired output files. However, the ER format configuration must be derived from the same ER invoice model mapping that is configured in Finance or Supply Chain Management to generate business documents.

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/localizations/e-invoicing-faq.md" sourcestartlinenumber="133">Yes. However, it requires customizing the invoice model mapping and adding the necessary references to the custom-made tables, or depending on the complexity, creating a new invoice model mapping.</p>
