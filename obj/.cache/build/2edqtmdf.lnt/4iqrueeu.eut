<h2 id="can-i-change-the-party-type-of-a-record-or-do-i-have-to-delete-the-old-record-and-create-a-new-one" sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="45">Can I change the party type of a record, or do I have to delete the old record and create a new one?</h2>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="47">Occasionally, you might have to change the party type of a record from person to organization or from organization to person. For example, Nancy is a member of the sales team for Fabrikam U.K. At a trade show in London, she meets six new prospects. Nancy creates a prospect party record for each prospect. When Nancy saves the records, each record is also created in the global address book. Fabrikam has set the default party type to organization, but two of the new prospects should have a record type of person. Therefore, when Nancy returns from the trade show, she must change the party type of the two prospect records. To change a party record from one party type to another, you must first create a new party record of the correct type in the global address book. You then associate the old party record with this new record. After you have made the new party association, delete the original party record that has the incorrect record type.</p>

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="51">You can update the name of a party record, and the addresses that are associated with that record, at any time.</p>

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="58">Occasionally, you might want to merge two or more party records into a single record. This can occur if you create one or more duplicate party records, either on purpose or unintentionally. When you merge party records, you select one record to keep. The information from the other records is then merged into this record. For example, you discover that information about Fabrikam is stored in three party records: A, B, and C. You decide to keep party record A. Therefore, the information that is stored in party records B and C will be merged into party record A. There are some situations where you can't merge party records:</p>
<ul sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">
<li sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="60">You can't merge party records that are associated with the same party role, such as customer or vendor, in the same legal entity. For example, party A is associated with a customer in legal entity 123, and party B is associated with a different customer in legal entity 123. These party records can't be merged, because if they were merged, the merged party record would be associated with multiple customers in the same legal entity, and this isn't allowed. However, the records can be merged if party B is associated with a vendor in legal entity 123 or with a customer in a different legal entity.</li>
<li sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="61">You can't merge internal party organization records in the same legal entity, team, or operating unit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="should-i-create-a-party-record-in-the-global-address-book-or-in-another-place-such-as-the-customer-or-vendor-page" sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="63">Should I create a party record in the global address book or in another place, such as the Customer or Vendor page?</h2>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">You can enter party records either in the global address book or on the appropriate entity page. When you add a record in one location, the same record is always added in the other location. For example, if you add a party record for a customer in the global address book, the record is also added on the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">Customer</strong> page. Likewise, if you add a party record for a customer on the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="65">Customer</strong> page, the record is also added in the global address book. Use the following guidelines to decide where you should enter new party records:</p>
<ul sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">
<li sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67"><strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="67">Creating a party record when you don't know the entity type</strong> – If you must create a party record but don't know the entity type (for example, you don't know whether the entity is a customer or an opportunity), create the record in the global address book. You can select the entity type later.</li>
<li sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68"><strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Creating a party record when you know the entity type</strong> – If you know the entity type for the party, you can create a record on the applicable page for that type. For example, create a record for a customer on the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="68">Customer</strong> page. When you create and save a record by using the appropriate entity page, the record is automatically created in the global address book.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-i-translate-address-information-for-party-records" sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Can I translate address information for party records?</h2>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">You can set up translations of address information, so that the information appears in your user language (system language) in your program, but in another language on documents such as sales orders. You can enter translations for country/region names, address purposes, and name sequences. For example, your system language is Danish, and you create a sales order for a customer in France. In this case, you can view the customer record in Danish in the program but display the address information in French on the printed sales order. When you set up translations, you should enter a translation for every item in the list. Any item that you don't enter a translation for will appear in the system language. For example, your system language is Danish, and you send a document to a customer in Spain. If you haven't entered Spanish (ESP) translations for the address information, that information will appear in Danish both in the program and on the printed document.</p>
<h2 id="after-importing-addresses-when-i-access-the-records-why-am-i-unable-to-edit-imported-addresses" sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">After importing addresses, when I access the records why am I unable to edit imported addresses?</h2>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">When importing addresses there is a field labeled <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">IsLocationOwner</strong>, which indicates whether the party that is associated to the location (address) is the owner of the address. If the party is the owner of the address, the address can be edited when accessed using the party in the global address book or from the master record form (such as customer, vendor, or worker). If the party is not the owner of the address, the record cannot be edited from the previously listed forms. When importing addresses, <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">IsLocationOwner</strong> should be set to <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Yes</strong> if you want the address to be editable using the associated party. However, there are times when this field is imported incorrectly. To fix this issue, the location owner can be updated within the global address book from the party record or from the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Confirm location owners</strong> page. To update a single party record, go to <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Global Address Book &gt; Address</strong>.

If the previous location owner is blank this means that a location owner wasn’t established. Selecting the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Advanced</strong> option will open the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Manage addresses</strong> page where the location owner can also be set. Select the location to be updated, and then select <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Set location owner</strong> from the menu. To update the location owner for multiple records, go to <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Global Address Book &gt; Locations &gt; Confirm location owners</strong>. The list contains locations that are linked to single party, but that party is not the owner. Selecting <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Confirm owner</strong> will set the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Proposed owning party ID</strong> to be the owner of the linked address. After the party is set as the owner, the linked address will be editable from the party record. In order to change the location owner, you must be assigned the privilege <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Set location owner</strong> on the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/organization-administration/qa-address-books.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">Security configuration</strong> page.
