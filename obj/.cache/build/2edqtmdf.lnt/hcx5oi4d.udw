<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/hr/localizations/noam-usa-garnishment-tax-levy-enrollment-tasks.md" sourcestartlinenumber="40">When the Payroll department is notified about a court-ordered garnishment or tax levy, the federal government requires that deductions begin within a specific number of days. As for other garnishment rules, some states might use federal rules, or they might set their own requirements. For example, a state might require that deductions begin in the first payroll payment, no later than three days after the court order is received. Because this payment might occur in the current pay period, it's in your interest to enroll workers as quickly as possible.</p>

The calculation priority is important when the result of the calculation for one benefit is used in the calculation for another benefit. For example, in some states, the deductions for union dues and health plans reduce disposable income. To make sure that the garnishment is calculated correctly, you must make sure that union dues and health plans have a lower calculation priority number than the garnishment has. For tax levies, voluntary benefit enrollments that were in place before the tax levy typically have higher priority than the tax levy. Therefore, those benefits must have a lower calculation priority number than the tax levy.<blockquote>[!NOTE] Your legal advisors should help you determine the correct calculation priority for all benefits.</blockquote></td>

To deduct the administrative fee, you must create a benefit for the administrative fee and then assign that benefit to the worker.

<ul>
<li><strong>None</strong> – The garnishment should not be included in a group of garnishments.</li>
<li><strong>Pro rata</strong> – The deduction is divided so that each garnishment receives a proportionate amount.</li>
<li><strong>Equal</strong> – The deduction is divided so that each garnishment receives an equal amount.</li>
<li><strong>First in</strong> – The garnishments are satisfied in the order in which the worker enrolled in them. This option is typically used for tax levies.</li>

<blockquote>[!IMPORTANT] If the court order doesn't specify which method to use, check with your legal advisors for clarification. Typically, if the orders have the same type but are from different states, the laws in the state where the worker works apply. For example, a worker who is located in Washington has three orders: two from California and one from Idaho. The rules for Washington apply to all three orders. However, if this worker has two support orders from California and a creditor garnishment from Idaho, the support orders use the California rules, and the creditor garnishment uses the Idaho rules. If it isn't clear which method you should use, check with your legal advisors.</blockquote></td>

Typically, if the orders have the same type but are from different states, the laws in the state where the worker works apply. For example, a worker who is located in Washington has three support orders: two from California and one from Idaho. The rules for Washington apply to all three orders. However, if this worker has two support orders from California and a creditor garnishment from Idaho, the support orders use the California rules and the creditor garnishment uses the Idaho rules. If it isn't clear which method you should use, check with your legal advisors.</blockquote>
