<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="36">At the end of a fiscal year, you must run the year-end close process to transfer opening balances to the new year. Most organizations will run the year-end close process multiple times. The first run moves the balances into the new fiscal year. The process can then be rerun as many times as required to move the balances from adjusting entries into the new fiscal year.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="38">During the year-end close process, there are two types of possible transactions created. An Opening transaction is always generated and is used to create the opening balances in the new fiscal year. The Opening transaction shows the balance sheet ledger account balances in the new fiscal year and balances from the profit and loss ledger account balances in the retained earnings ledger account in the new fiscal year. The Closing transaction is optionally created to bring the balances of the profit and loss accounts down to zero in the fiscal year being closed.</p>

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">After the system is configured, the year-end close process can be run. On the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="70">Year-end close template setup</strong> page, a template can be defined for the group of legal entities that the year-end close process will be run for. The template will be reused at each year-end close, but it can be modified if your organization changes.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">First, set the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="72">Group name</strong> field for the template, and select the fiscal calendar. The group name should identify the group of legal entities that is included. When you're determining the groups of legal entities, remember that legal entities can be included in the same group only if the same fiscal calendar is selected for them. For example, the templates can be set up based on geography, and separate groups can be created for North American legal entities, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) legal entities, and Asia-Pacific (APAC) legal entities.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="74">Next, the legal entities can be added to the template. Legal entities can be added by selecting an organizational hierarchy or by selecting the legal entities. If an organizational hierarchy is selected, only legal entities within the hierarchy that use the selected fiscal calendar will be added to the template. If you use legal entities to add to the template, only legal entities with the same fiscal calendar can be added. The same fiscal calendar is required because the year-end close is run by selecting a fiscal year, which can vary from calendar to calendar.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="76">After the legal entities are added, define the retained earnings main accounts for each legal entity.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">The <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="78">Financial dimension</strong> tab is used to define which financial dimensions will be used on the opening transaction.

You must repeat the setup for each legal entity in the grid.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">The <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">Transfer balance sheet dimensions</strong> option is used to specify whether the financial dimensions on transactions that are posted to balance sheet accounts should be maintained on the opening transaction. As a best practice, this option should be set to <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">Yes</strong>. The setting for the balance sheet dimensions doesn't affect existing balances in the retained earnings ledger accounts. Those balances are determined by the profit and loss dimensions that are defined in the next section. For example, fiscal year 2019 was the first year that was closed, and the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">Close all</strong> option was used to select the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">Department</strong> and <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">Cost center</strong> dimensions for closing. In this case, a separate retained earnings account was created for each combination of a department and a cost center. When the year-end close is run for fiscal year 2020, the retained earnings from the previous year remain exactly as they were posted, even if the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">Transfer balance sheet dimensions</strong> is set to <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="80">No</strong>. Balances that are posted to retained earnings from previous year-end closes are never changed.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">The <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Transfer profit and loss dimensions</strong> section is used to specify which financial dimensions on transactions that are posted to profit and loss accounts will be transferred to the retained earnings main account. First, identify the financial dimensions that are relevant to the selected legal entity. These financial dimensions include any financial dimension that was posted against during the year, even if the financial dimension isn't part of an active account structure. Next, define each dimension as either <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Close single</strong> or <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Close all</strong>. The default option is <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Close all</strong>. This option maintains the original financial dimension values from posted transactions and uses them to create the opening balances for the retained earnings account. Separate retained earnings beginning balances will be created for each unique combination of financial dimension values. If <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Close single</strong> is selected, all posted transactions that have that financial dimension will be summarized into a retained earnings beginning balance for the dimension value that is entered in the field that appears after <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Close single</strong>. For example, all transactions for the fiscal year were posted with the account structure <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Main account - Department</strong>. For the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Department</strong> financial dimension on the template, <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Close single</strong> is selected, and <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">100</strong> is entered as the dimension value. If the total income of all transactions that are posted to departments 200, 300, and 400 is $100,000, one opening balance will be created for <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Retained earnings - 100</strong>. If you select <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="82">Close single</strong> but leave the financial dimension value blank, all transactions will be posted to retained earnings, and the dimension value will be blank.</p>

<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">After the year-end close templates are created, you can initiate the year-end close process on the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">Year-end close</strong> page (<strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">General ledger &gt; Period close &gt; Year-end close</strong>). Before you run the year-end close, you can add new year-end close templates or modify existing templates by selecting <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="86">Year-end close template setup</strong> to open the setup page for the templates.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">Select the year-end close template, and then, on the Action Pane, select <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="88">Run year-end close</strong>. Select either all legal entities or a subset of legal entities from the template that you're running the year-end close for. If you're running the year-end close for the first time in a fiscal year, you will probably select all the legal entities, so that you create beginning balances for all of them. If you've previously run the year-end close, you might want to rerun it only for the legal entities that adjusting entries were posted for.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="90">Next, select the fiscal year to run the year-end close process against. If more than one closing period exists for the last period of the fiscal year, the <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="90">Period name</strong> field becomes available. You can then select the closing period to use to post the closing transaction, if the setup is defined to create the closing transaction.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="92">Next, enter a voucher number. The same voucher number will be used for all the legal entities that you've selected for the year-end close process. The voucher number isn't generated by using a number sequence.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="94">By default, the year-end close process runs in batch mode. Therefore, after you initiate it, you can return to other activities.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">Because account structures can change throughout a fiscal year, the relevant account structure can't always be identified. Therefore, the year-end close process doesn't adhere to account structures. When opening transactions are created, the balances are brought forward with financial dimensions, as defined in the year-end close template. The beginning balances entries can include financial dimensions that are no longer in the current account structure and segment combinations that are no longer valid in the current account structure. If your organization wants to exclude a financial dimension for the retained earnings beginning balance, define the financial dimension as <strong sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="96">Close single</strong>, and leave the dimension value blank.</p>
<p sourcefile="ProcessDoku/02_SupportProcesses/02_01_Finance/general-ledger/year-end-close.md" sourcestartlinenumber="98">After the process is completed, a record is created for each combination of a legal entity and a fiscal year.
